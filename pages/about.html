            <h4>Scholarship</h4>
            <p>
                Our first and foremost ideal is the pursuit of academic knowledge. The primary goal of each Brother must be 
                the completion of a college education. Therefore, each member has an obligation to maintain a sound academic record. 
                This is an obligation that he owes to his family, his Brothers, the Fraternity, and himself. Since its conception, 
                Phi Kappa Sigma has emphasized scholarship and academic excellence. Initiation into, and active membership in the 
                Fraternity is dependent upon maintaining good academic standing.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Fraternity</h4>
            <p>
                Phi Kappa Sigma is not merely another college organization, it is a lifetime commitment. Each member should be 
                thoroughly acquainted with all aspects of the Fraternity, both internationally and locally. Each Brother and 
                New Member is expected to take on the the fullest role in the affairs of our Chapter that his capabilities and 
                experience permit, since our Chapter is only as strong as its members. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Personal Conduct</h4>
            <p>
                As one of our goals as a Fraternity is to develop our members into "Men of Honor", all members are expected to 
                conduct their affairs in a gentlemanly manner at all times. This bears added significance in that the actions of 
                our members reflect not only upon our Chapter, but on the Fraternity as a whole. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Financial Commitment</h4>
            <p>
                Our Chapter is a cooperative organization that is dependent upon its member for its existence. Therefore, it is 
                imperative that each member meet his financial obligations to the Chapter in a timely manner, in order that the our 
                Chapter may discharge its financial obligations. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>College/Universiy</h4>
            <p>
                Phi Kappa Sigma has always maintained that fraternities are an integral component of higher education, one of 
                immeasurable value. Our Chapter has always strived to maintain a good relationship with Illinois Institute of 
                Technology. Mutual cooperation and participation in Illinois Tech's educational and cultural programs have kept 
                this relationship strong.
